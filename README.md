# Concert-TIcket-Ordering-System

The concert ticket ordering system is the web-based system. The system has two types of users: administrators and registered users. The administrators and registered users need to perform login authentication. Finally, entering the correct account information on the login interface, the administrator can query, enter, modify, and delete the basic information of the concert ticket. The basic information of the concert ticket is as follows: concert name, place, date, start time, grade (points A, B, C, etc.), fare, preset seats, remaining seats. Concert ticket ordering system is written in PHP and MYSQL.

Ordinary users can query concert ticket information, and query concert ticket information by concert name, date, and start time. Eventually, Ordinary users can start booking tickets after finding the appropriate concert tickets. You need to enter when booking: ID number, concert name, date, show time, screening hall. After confirming the booking, the relevant information is recorded in the booking form, and at the same time, the remaining seats corresponding to the concert ticket are reduced by one. (Not taking into account payment issues or refunds).
